## Exercise 1

In the Lesson 3 presentation you saw how to use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to compare the difference in median repair times for Macs and PCs.  You'll find the `repair` dataset in the `DS705data` package.  In this problem we'll test the hypothesis that the population mean repair times are different for Macs and PCs at the 5% significance level using three different approaches.

$$ H_0: \mu_{\mbox{PC}} = \mu_{\mbox{Mac}}$$
$$H_a:  \mu_{\mbox{PC}} \neq \mu_{\mbox{Mac}} $$

### Part 1a

Even though repair times for both computer types are skewed right go ahead and use `t.test` to test if the population mean times are significantly different.  Include your R code below and write a conclusion to the test for practice.

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1a -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Replace with your conclusion.

### Part 1b

Now use the `boot` package to construct a 95% BCa confidence interval for the difference in population mean repair times.  Use at least 5000 resamples.  Use that confidence interval to write a hypothesis test conclusion to this hypothesis test.  (Review: you made similar bootstrap CI's in Lesson 3.)

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1b -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Replace with your conclusion.

---

### Part 1c

Follow along with with Two Means example in the Bootstrap Hypothesis Testing presentation to bootstrap the two means t test to see if there is a significant difference in population mean repair times.  Include a histrogram of the boostrapped t-distribution and write a conclusion to the hypothesis test.  (NOTE: in the P value computation slide the last part got cut off, the full code is `P <- 2*min( sum( bootdist < toriginal), sum( bootdist > toriginal ) )/5000`.)

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1c -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
# your code goes here
```

Replace with your conclusion.

### Part 1d

## Exercise 2

This exercise is based on the data and experimental design from exercises 8.42 & 8.43 in the Ott textbook.

A small corporation makes insulation shields for electrical wires using three different types of machines. The corporation wants to evaluate the variation in the inside diameter dimension of the shields produced by the machines. A quality engineer at the corporation randomly selects shields produced by each of the machines and records the inside diameters of each shield (in millimeters). The goal is to determine whether the location parameters (i.e. mean or median) of the three machines differ. The data set `shields` is in the `DS705data` package.  The R code to load it is already below.

### Part 2a

Construct side-by-side boxplots for the inside diameters of the insulation shields for the three machines.

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 2a -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
require(DS705data)
data(shields)

```

### Part 2b

Comment on what you see in the boxplots.  How do the medians compare visually?  Do the samples look like they have roughly the same variability?  Is there severe skewness or outliers in any of the samples?  Be specific.

### Part 2o

Often the Kruskall Wallis test is presented as a test of 

$H_0:$ the population distributions are all the same

$H_1:$ the population distributions are not all the same,

but this is not what KW tests as this example shows.  Take 3 random samples of size 100 from normal distributions having mean 0 and standard deviations 1, 10, and 50.  If KW were testing the hypotheses above, then we should reject $H_0$ since these three distributions are clearly different.  Run the KW test.  You should get a large $P$-value.  Why did you get a large $P$-value when the distributions are so different?

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 2o -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r echo = TRUE}
set.seed(321)
x <- c( rnorm(100,0,1), rnorm(100,0,10), rnorm(100,0,50))
groups <- factor( (rep( c('A','B','C'), each=100 ) ) )
# complete the code here ...
